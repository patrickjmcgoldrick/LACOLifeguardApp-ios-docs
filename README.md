# Purpose
Telestaff as a terrible web interface.  The mobile web interface is even more crippled than the desktop version.

This app aims to solve many problems
* #1 - Make yourself available for multiple days at a time (just pick to dates on the calendar)
* Never have to enter login credentials again, unless you change your password
* Picklist for both Today and Tomorrow are at your fingertips
* Nicely formatted calendar with Total Hours for 1st - 15th and 16th-31st of the month.
* Easily flip between months in the calendar
